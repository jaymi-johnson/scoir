# SCOIR Technical Interview for Front-End Engineers

This repo contains an exercise intended for Front-End Engineers.

## Instructions

1. Click "Use this template" to create a copy of this repository in your personal github account.
1. Using technology of your choice, complete [the assignment](./Assignment.md).
   - Our preference would be to see this in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with the UI implemented using [MUI](https://mui.com/)
1. Update this README with
   - a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to run/access your system.
   - an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Send an email with a link to your newly created repo containing the completed exercise.

## Expectations

1. This exercise is meant to drive a conversation.
1. Please invest only enough time needed to demonstrate your approach to problem solving, code design, etc.
1. Within reason, treat your solution as if it would become a production system.

## How-To

### Running the React App

1. Install dependencies `npm i`
1. Run app `npm start`
1. Run tests `npm test`

- Only included a few tests for reference but wanted to return the assignment in a timely manner.

## Assumptions

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
1. We are only searching and catching dogs by Breeds NOT sub-breeds.
1. Design is suggested - modified slightly and used a simple theme to display competency of UI design.

## What I would include with more time

1. Test coverage
1. A redux store OR graphQL hooks for handling API calls depending on the type of API (for this one specifically, it would be a store). As to not create fetch calls directly from the components.
1. Dive deeper into design with the designer.

# Thank you!

Thanks again for the time you've spent to getting to know me and reviewing this code. I look forward to discussing it further and getting the opportunity to work with you!
